#Parcel :

1- Dev Build
2-Local Server 
3-Hot Module Replacement(HMR) - it will be relaced only thoings which are actually changes and reload it
4-File watching algorith - so for tracing all the file in Application File watching algorith is used and it is written in c++
5-cashing - faster builds- when we start the server or create buildthat time react itself create a folder parcel-cache so it will be load our app/file faster and when we again and again save file so that time also changes wil chow in milisecond(quick)
6-Image optimisation
7-Bundling - this is main work on parcel
8-minification
9-compression - it will remove void space in code and make file lite for production
10-consistant Hashing 
11-Code Spliting 
12-It will Do diffrential Bundling to support older Browser 
13-Better Error Suggetion
14-HTTPS
15-Tree Shaking- Parcel will remove unwanted code
react is fast no doubt but due to parcel it got extra push to make things fast

There are two types of export 

1-is By export default  components
  -export  default components
  -import component from "path"

2-Named export/import

 -export const component  
 -import {component} from path 

 #There are two types of Routing in web app
 1=Client Side Routing 
 2=Server side Routing




{
  /*
so basically in react there are three main phases are there 1]Mounting 2]Updatig 3]Unmounting
lets talk on mounting:- 
so every phases it has two stages are there one is render stage and commit stage
so react will render the whole componenet first if child components are there react will make an bunch and render first 
then react comes in second phase is commit phase in which dom manaipulation api call will happen 
in commit phase then react load an api through ComponentDidMount and get data and load on UI 
so this will be life cycle of class based react component

  */
}


{/*
  Based On this for above how life cycle work 

  --This three stages are render phase

  -parent constructor call
  -parent render call

    -sameer pathan child 1 constructor call 
    -sameer pathan child 1 render call

    -elon bhai child 2 constructor call
    -elon bhai child 2 render call

  -- This below stages are commit phases it runs after render complete for all components 

    -sameer pahan 1 ComponentDidMount call
    -elon bhai child 2 ComponentDidMount call

  -Parent ComponentDidMount call

  Types of testing(developer)

  1]Unit Testing  ==> You can test your react component in isolation 
  2]Integrartion Testing
  3]End to End Testing (e2e testing)
